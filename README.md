## Installation 

Welcome to weatherApp. Weather App was designed for travelers looking to find important weather data based on a City.

notice you have a search bar for entering the city you would like to search. The current days forecast will be displayed in The Bigger card at the top.
Below you will see the section for a 5 day forecast. Allowing users to see the weather conditions for the next 5 days

## Highlights
Weather App is my first introduction to API's and also my first time using Jquery inside an application. I like the functionality of the application. By clicking the submit button It fires off a function (Search for City) that makes 2 sepearte api requests to retrieve data. Inside the fivedayforecast function I'm looping over the data to return humidity and temperature for five days in advance. 

## Current Needs
This project is in need of an updated CSS layout. There is an issue with the dynamically created buttons not being searchable. I believe this is because of JQuery and how it handles dynamic properties being added to the DOM.

## Project Expansion
I see this project being combined with my work day planner, and note taking application to make a one stop shop for planning a successful day.
