## Installation 

Welcome to weatherApp. Weather App was designed for travelers looking to find important weather data based on a City.

When you first arrive at our screeen it will look something like the picture below

notice you have a search bar for entering the city you would like to search. The current days forecast will be displayed in The Bigger card at the top.
Below you will see the section for a 5 day forecast. Allowing users to see the weather conditions for the next 5 days

This app is still in its early stages so if you pull up our console you'll see a few logs. This is strictly so I can pick up where i left off and provide users a better overall experience.
